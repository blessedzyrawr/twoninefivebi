							<p class="big-text">We are the ones weâ€™ve been waiting for. Yes we can. America, this is our moment. Yes we can. For we have a choice in this country. Hope! I'm inspired by the love people have for their children. These things are true. Hope is not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. There will be setbacks and false starts.</p>

							<p>We need change. We may come from different places and have different stories, but we share common hopes, and one very American dream. Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change. We are a people of improbable hope. The audacity of hope! In distilled form, though, the explanations of both the right and the left have become mirror images of each other. We need change. The audacity of hope! The audacity of hope! We are a people of improbable hope.</p>

										<p>I would not have intervened. I discourage a cult of personality. People need to hear what I have to say. People need to hear what I have to say. It is impossible to maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies. It doesn't matter what I live. It doesn't matter what I do. All I'm suggesting that it's not going to be very effective and that people are going to get sick of it very fast.</p>
										<p>We could get engaged by this standard in all sorts of places. The problem isn't too little money in political campaigns, but not enough. You can't trust anybohdy with power. We exercise a no-fly zone this evening. We exercise a no-fly zone this evening. I discourage a cult of personality. We're all human and we all goof. It doesn't matter what I do.</p>

It is a sign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus. Yes we can. Yes we can.</p></blockquote>

							<p>There will be setbacks and false starts. The audacity of hope! Yes, we can heal this nation. We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We need change. This is our time. Yes, we can seize our future. There will be setbacks and false starts. The audacity of hope! We can do that.</p>
